# Gesture Recognition
>  Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
Stop: Pause the movie

The training data consists of a few hundred videos categorised into one of the five classes. Each video (typically 2-3 seconds long) is divided into a sequence of 30 frames(images). These videos have been recorded by various people performing one of the five gestures in front of a webcam - similar to what the smart TV will use.
